      <h2>Why STB Exists</h2>
      <p>India has plenty to learn from scale, but there's no clear system to reach earning potential. YouTube is overloaded, courses are cluttered and there's no guidance. SKILL TO BILL replaces this entire platform with a straight forward, clean, step-by-step earning system.</p>
